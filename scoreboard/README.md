# Geek Off scoring system - Python Scoreboard

## Purpose

This is the Python scoreboard for the Geek Off. It connects to the database and subscribes to an event listener to automatically get changes to the scores from the database.

This was created because of complaints on the past scoreboard being a web page that refreshed every 30 seconds.

This runs on a separate Raspberry Pi Zero W that is connected via wireless to the Geek-O-Matic master control unit.

### How it works

The scoreboard will automatically change based on the round of play loaded in the database.

Fonts used in the scoreboard are not included for copyright reasons. These fonts can be found as follows:

| Font name | URL | Use |

| fast-money-three.ttf | https://fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/1181116/fast_money_three | Round 1 board |
