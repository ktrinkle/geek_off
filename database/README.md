# Geek Off scoring system - Database

## Purpose

This will contain the database tables and views used for the Geek Off. That is, when I get around to exporting the DDLs.

The database runs on Postgres.

## Running this yourself

Create a database and user ID to run this code in Postgres. Deploy the objects under that user ID, or ensure that the user ID you run the application under has SUID access to the tables and select access to the views.
